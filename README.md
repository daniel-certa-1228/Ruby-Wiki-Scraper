# Ruby Wikipedia Table Scraper

A basic table scraper.

[wiki_table_scraper.rb](https://github.com/daniel-certa-1228/Ruby-Wiki-Scraper/blob/master/wiki_table_scraper.rb) scrapes the table of Beatles songs from [Wikipeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_the_Beatles) and saves the contents to a CSV file.

[csv_to_json.rb](https://github.com/daniel-certa-1228/Ruby-Wiki-Scraper/blob/master/csv_to_json.rb) manipulates the data into two different JSON files.
